            <p id="p1"> Norma Leticia Figueroa, over the past few months I have always had an amazing time with you.
            From showing you around Dallas the first day to just lounging around your apartment watching
            The Outer Banks, I could not find a more perfect way to spend my time. I hope you have had
            as much fun as I have!            
            </p>

            <p id="p2">I made this website hoping I could do something unique and memorable for you. I wanted to
            go above and beyond for you. I want to show you that I will always go out of my way, even with
            the smallest things for you. I want to be the one who always brings a smile to your face and makes you
            laugh when you need it the most.
